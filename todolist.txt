    #KNOWN BUGS

# weird jankiness happens if the player collides with a non-sloping platform and a sloping platform at the same time.

# giant frogs only occupy one tile. (this might have been fixed in the version nick has.)

# Bats can fly outside the level and disappear.

# player can end up in a "None" level (and crash game) when leaving a level.
    #this can occur with certain combinations of sprinting/jumping while leaving the level.
    #so far it seems to only happen when leaving the level horizontally while jumping and
        #sprinting through a gap of the same height as the player.
    #it's possible that other bugs may occur if the player does this combination of actions, even when not leaving the level.

    (some classes are not listed here)
    (Also do this for all LevelEditor classes)

IMMEDIATE STUFF: signs, cutscenes, events, dialog

-------------------------------------------------------------

# make an NPC for the player to talk to. (use kenstar from girlchan in paradise)
    - make sure to set dialog scrolling on for NPC dialogue (unless it's a minor character, maybe?)
    - don't need to focus too much on general NPC mechanics for now-- make things very abstract so they can be used later, though.
    - do this in an added level.
    - also make a dialogue portrait and a system to access them from file.

# implement yes/no options (selected with arrow keys) for dialogs

# Make signs get their text (and number of panes of text, etc) through a more general process

# figure out how to give the existing dialog boxes borders, maybe even make them loaded images instead.
    - could make a nice little "sign" image with a wooden grain
    - make it more visually clear that signs are waiting for a button input. (maybe a blinking icon?)

# figure out how to handle dialogue panes with multiple lines of text.

# Try to implement some more examples of cutscenes, like non-player characters with actions and scrolling dialogue.
    - use dialogue from girlchan in paradise as a test. It'll make it more fun.
    - Have Yusuke talking to Kenstar

# Think of a structure that will allow different events to happen at the same time in a cutscene 
    - i.e., entity A starts walking, entity B starts while A is still walking
    - this might work if actions are not ended when new actions start, meaning ending an action is an action in itself.
    - IDEA: different actions that make up a cutscene are linked to "next" actions, which execute when they are over.

# Finish the frameworks that will allow text, dialogs, events, cutscenes, etc.
    - Remember that some things should be skippable while others should not.
    - Test a number of different cutscene types for testing and implement them using the same general system.

    -------------------------------------------------------------

IMMEDIATE STUFF: screens, menus, movement

# make it possible for the player to open up a map screen.
    - Work with the general design for "screens", "menus", and "controls"

# IDEA to reduce lag: make level blit directly onto a pygame screen and simply change this screen when necessary using the screemanager.
    - Currently, the level blits onto an image which is then blitted onto a main screen, which is twice as much blitting as we really need.

# restructure player (and possibly entity) movement, possibly by using a dict to map situations/input to actions.
    - DEFINITELY draw a flowchart
    - consider making ice blocks (or some other example besides ladders) to test whether this system is really extensible.

# implement one-way platforms, doors, etc
# fix movement/rect related stuff, and put all relevant methods in gameImage, to be called by subclasses.
    # This is partially, maybe completely done, but make sure before removing this TODO.
# fix imports to be efficient/useful

    #LESS IMMEDIATE STUFF

# make lanterns run out with distanc
# consider making it so the player does not jump repeatedly if the jump button is held down.
# Make a launcher that makes it possible to select which dungeon to load
    # It may help to change the dungeoneditor to let the user give different dungeons different saved names.
    # A filelist would be useful for this.
# build the enemies extensibly. Make temporary classes/methods if necessary, but plan to replace them later
    # have the bat start hanging from the ceiling and maybe give it "dropping"
        # animation followed by the flying animation
    # change the bat's attack patterns so that it periodically flaps around the player before diving, bounces off, 
        # moves away, and then dives again.
        # (some randomness may make this pattern look more natural)
    # make lighting less laggy for large amounts of light
        # one way might be to only udpate tiles within rectangular areas around light sources.
    # consider possible combat systems (damage, HP, etc)
# reduce lag when player is in a cave 
    -monsters may affect the lag, though it mostly seems to come from the spreadLight method in Tile.
# reduce lag in dungeon editor, particularly for the level editor.
# consider removing level_ID, but first try to think of possible uses for it.
# figure out how to handle monsters in complete/partial darkness
    # I put an idea in Being class
    # Keep in mind that the being may occupy multiple tiles

    #SPRITE STUFF

#TODO: consider having tiles/textures be procedurally generated based on hardcoded platform locations/level data and a library of tiles.
       # Alternately, use the map editor and a tileFactory to load in tiles from images which represent levels using only entities.

        #ENEMY/AI STUFF

#TODO: implement more enemies. Try to give them very different behavior to force myself to expand the AI system.
    # when adding AI, try to be creative and extensible, as though this were a roguelike.
    #IDEA: could give some monsters strong knockback by increasing the bounce they deliver.
# NOTE: enemies remain in the exact same state they were left in when the player leaves a level. should decide if this is good or bad.

        #PLATFORM STUFF

#TODO: make the "platform" system more complex, possibly with inheritance/factory
# consider platforms that  the player can jump up through and/or fall through  by tapping down

        # MISC STUFF

#TODO: make invisible caverns which can be revealed somehow. (test in sunlight first)
#TODO: give exit blocks super terrifying sprites. (they can't be seen normally so it will be a fun surprise if there's a glitch or something)
#TODO: think up lots of cool easter eggs (though this might be more of a long-term thing)
