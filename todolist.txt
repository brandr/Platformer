    #KNOWN BUGS

# Bats can fly outside the level and disappear.

# This can happen to frogs, too. (though they have to be knocked out of the level)

# player can end up in a "None" level (and crash game) when leaving a level.
    #this can occur with certain combinations of sprinting/jumping while leaving the level.
    #so far it seems to only happen when leaving the level horizontally while jumping and
        #sprinting through a gap of the same height as the player.
    #it's possible that other bugs may occur if the player does this combination of actions, even when not leaving the level.

# when falling down a large chasm, player can get to the other side of a wall by holding left.
    - may be reproducible in more generalizable situations, like "leaving the level very quickly and diagonally"

MAIN GOAL: Build a demo showing off dialogs, cutscenes, lighting mechanics, etc. once all immediate stuff is finished.
    - the next demo should include inventory screen and lantern mechanics based on fading light/oil


-------------------------------------------------------------------

IMMEDIATE STUFF: most immediate

# IDEA: try having the main character's idle animation be completely still to see if I like it better.

# TODO: make the "hit spark" better (and possibly more general)
    - consider other ways to show that something is being damaged

# show that the player is being damaged (may want to make new, human sprites first so as not to waste more time with test sprites)

# fix the bug where the frog (and presumably the bat) can be knocked off the screen
# figure out a combat system 
    - may have to tweak some of the being/monster bounce system 
        * consider implementing knockback that affects both the monster attacking and the target
    - be extensible
    - use sword as an example
    - later, use gun/bow as example
# consider making the lantern a subentity of the player that appears when the player is in the dark
# figure out an item system
    - remember that lantern/sword are items but work very differently

# generalize subentities/entityeffects so that they can apply to monsters and NPCs

# implement "triggers" to traverse between dungeons
    - may want to first implement a system to allow saving dungeons by name via the dungeon editor

# implement a cutscene system and ways to trigger cutscenes

# make some sprites for the main character, archaeologist, sorceress, and the immortal

-------------------------------------------------------------------

IMMEDIATE STUFF: lighting system

# fix the lag caused in the new system
    - currently negligible, but try to make things more efficient anyway.
# consider a special case for lightdist == 1 because right now it looks weird.
# could make it so lighting doesn't snap to tiles, if that looks better
# there is a bug where the player can influence lighting even when not holding a lantern
    * this could possibly be fixed by controlling the angle the player approache the lantern from (i.e., no wall in the way) so that it looks like he is actually casting a shadow, which looks cool

-------------------------------------------------------------------

IMMEDIATE STUFF: screens and menus

# make the map screen more sophisticated. (get feedback)
    - consider how it should be centered (and how to scroll if there is not room for the entire explored area)
    - consider making parts of the map fade with time 
# make more panes to go with the map screen. (these should also be accessible via the pause menu)
    - one possible pane is inventory-- for this, make it possible to get the lantern as an upgrade, and have it contain oil which can be collected to increase light radius.
        * note that this will require some planning (should probably sketch the screen before making it)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

IMMEDIATE STUFF: movement

# come up with more movement examples to expand movement process
    - consider making ice blocks (or some other example besides ladders) to test whether this system is really extensible.

# implement one-way platforms, spikes, etc
# fix movement/rect related stuff, and put all relevant methods in gameImage, to be called by subclasses.
    # This is partially, maybe completely done, but make sure before removing this TODO

-------------------------------------------------------------

IMMEDIATE STUFF: dialog

# Make NPCS get their dialog data through a more general process
    - will require a lot of planning
        *this is because different actions in the game will affect NPC behavior/dialog later on.
        *need to start really implementing (or planning in detail) the game's main story 
            in order to flesh out the NPC system I'll need
    - IDEA: simple NPCs (which won't appear again) have their dialogs set similarly to signs,
            while main characters have "triggers" linked to text files and other saved data
            which make them appear.

# make portraits prettier (look at cave story, consult people, consider resizing, etc.)

# fix the SIGN arg that I use to determine the image for the dialog pane, or just make it so all dialog panes are the same (which I would prefer not to do)
    - this will change the NPC class, the dialog class (I think), and probaly the dialogchoice one (and maybe some others)

# figure out how to give the existing dialog boxes borders, maybe even make them loaded images instead.
    - could make a nice little "sign" image with a wooden grain
    - figure out what panes should be like for NPCs
    - make it more visually clear that dialogs are waiting for a button input. (maybe a blinking icon?)

# make it more visually clear when the player can press X to interact with something (this includes signs, NPCs, doors, and whatever else we make by this point)

# consider making Dialogs inherit from GameActions (or events?) instead of Effects, and make the level add/remove effects containing images based on the dialog.
    - not 100% sure about this as it might uneccessarily change existing structrue
    - note that this will affect DialogChoices, which inherit from Dialogs

-------------------------------------------------------------

IMMEDIATE STUFF: cutscenes

# Try to implement some more examples of cutscenes, like two non-player characters with actions and scrolling dialogue.
    - use dialogue from girlchan in paradise as a test. It'll make it more fun.
    - Have Yusuke talking to Kenstar
    - to test something I'll probably use a lot: 
        * have Yusuke start on the screen, but not Kenstar
        * make the cutscene start when the player talks to Yusuke
        * Have the cutscene "create" Kenstar off the left edge of the screen and make him walk on
        * Test different facial expressions in the portraits
        * use other actions from there (don't care as much about these)
        * maybe end with Kenstar leaving and Yusuke staying (you can talk to him, but it doesn't start a new cutscene)
        * alternately, figure out how to keep Kenstar but take away his cutscene trigger.
    - probably use that scene where they're about to fight but spend forever talking instead
        * still have actions mixed with dialogue for testing reasons, though

# Think of a structure that will allow different events to happen at the same time in a cutscene 
    - i.e., entity A starts walking, entity B does something while A is still walking
    - this might work if actions are not ended when new actions start, meaning ending an action is an action in itself.
    - IDEA: different actions that make up a cutscene are linked to "next" actions, which execute when they are over.

# Finish and clean up the frameworks that will handle text, dialogs, events, cutscenes, etc.
    - Remember that some things should be skippable while others should not.
    - Test a number of different cutscene types for testing and implement them using the same general system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    #LESS IMMEDIATE STUFF

# implement collectable items of some kind and an inventory screen
    - will require a lot of planning as far as actual game design
# make lanterns run out with distance
    - this means implementing lantern as a held object, making it different that the current system.
    - Need to figure out how the player will interface with "Lantern oil" amounts and how that system will work.
# consider making it so the player does not jump repeatedly if the jump button is held down.
# Make a launcher that makes it possible to select which dungeon to load
    # It may help to change the dungeoneditor to let the user give different dungeons different saved names.
    # A filelist would be useful for this.
# build the enemies extensibly. Make temporary classes/methods if necessary, but plan to replace them later
    # have the bat start hanging from the ceiling and maybe give it "dropping"
        # animation followed by the flying animation
    # change the bat's attack patterns so that it periodically flaps around the player before diving, bounces off, 
        # moves away, and then dives again.
        # (some randomness may make this pattern look more natural)
# consider possible combat systems (damage, HP, etc)
# consider removing level_ID, but first try to think of possible uses for it.
# figure out how to handle monsters in complete/partial darkness
    # I put an idea in Being class
    # Keep in mind that the being may occupy multiple tiles

    # USER SUGGESTIONS

# make it so when reading signs, the "continue reading" button is the same as the "start reading button"
# Add pigs (simon)

---------------------------------------------------------------


    # REDUCING LAG


# IDEA to reduce lag: instead of having the level constantly check for up-interacatbles, simply generate a list stored in levelobjects
    when the level is created
    - do this for all the indivdual object types (monsters, platforms, etc) as well.

# IDEA: make sure the level only bothers to render the images of onscreen enemies

    #SPRITE STUFF

#TODO: consider having tiles/textures be procedurally generated based on hardcoded platform locations/level data and a library of tiles.
       # Alternately, use the map editor and a tileFactory to load in tiles from images which represent levels using only entities. 
            *(i.e., entities against a white background with variable images.)

    # ENEMY/AI STUFF

#TODO: implement more enemies. Try to give them very different behavior to force myself to expand the AI system.
    # when adding AI, try to be creative and extensible, as though this were a roguelike.
    #IDEA: could give some monsters strong knockback by increasing the bounce they deliver.
# NOTE: enemies remain in the exact same state they were left in when the player leaves a level. should decide if this is good or bad.

    # PLATFORM STUFF

#TODO: make the "platform" system more complex, possibly with inheritance/factory
# consider platforms that  the player can jump up through and/or fall through  by tapping down
# consider platforms that hurt the player when touched
# consider moving platforms (might not fit into the existing tile -> block system, and therefore might not inherit from Platform)

    # MISC STUFF

# fix imports to be efficient/useful
#TODO: make invisible caverns which can be revealed somehow. (test in sunlight first)
#TODO: give exit blocks super terrifying sprites. (they can't be seen normally so it will be a fun surprise if there's a glitch or something)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

    # LONG-TERM STUFF

# change the player sprites to match my concept art
# since being in the dark with no light could make it extremely tedious to get out, make a "suicide" option and ensure that death
    has siginficant pentalties and sends the player back to a save point where they are guaranteed to have access to light
        - want to structure the game partly around this system
# make it possible for the player to save the game
# think up lots of cool easter eggs 
# when actually implementing the game, make sure that at some point the player is forced to go through dark areas with no lantern/empty lantern
    so that they know what it's like.
